# IntruisionDetectionSystem with Machine Learning
This is our Master thesis project which is titled:
Analysis of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) with Machine Learning

We are going to detect zero day attack using reinforcement learning algorithm.

Here we  used Deep Q network (DQN) algorithm to detect DdoS , Probe , R2L  and spoofing attack.
